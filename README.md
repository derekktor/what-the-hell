# header

Here lies the description
So far, I think I will be making a lot of comments/notes throughout this tutorial
This will be extremely time-consuming, but what the hell?
When you take notes, you are processing the info slightly deeper than just watching and listening and letting your mind wander at any moment

Anyway, md extension is for distinguishing markdown files
Markdown is a markup language that basically makes the document easier to read for users/humans
Markup language is a programming paradigm where certain syntaxes that the computer can read is not displayed but helps the remaining text to be emphasized
HTML is hypertext markup language so head, body, div, and table do not appear on the screen but helps the data entered within them appear in a more coherent way
And at the top of the text, you see header followed by hashtag, which makes the following text appear bigger and in bold font style

btw, that extended optional description for commit message doesn't appear on the main menu
